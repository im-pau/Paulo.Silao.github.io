        <h2>Hey,</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            I'm Paulo Silao, 22 years old, born on July 22, 2001. I come from a family of five, with four siblings, and I'm the third in the birth order. I attended Pedro E. Diaz High School for my high school education and pursued an Information Communication and Technology (ICT) strand at Cupang National High School for Senior High School. My expectation for the subject Information Management is to gain a solid understanding of how to efficiently organize and utilize data for various purposes. Five years from now, I envision myself working at a prominent tech company, utilizing my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative projects and advancements in the field. Thanks for visiting!
